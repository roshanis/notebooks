        "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Collaborative Task Solving with Multiple Agents and Human Users\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framwork allows tool use and human participance through multi-agent conversation. Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we demonstrate an application involving multiple agents and human users to work together and accomplish a task. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We create multiple `UserProxyAgent` instances which can represent different human users.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Education**: Educate the patient about diabetes, its complications, and the role of medication in managing the disease. Explain how the medication works and why it's important to take it regularly.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Empathy**: Understand the patient's concerns and fears about the medication. Address these concerns with empathy and provide reassurance.\n",
